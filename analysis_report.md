1. Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze a sales dataset containing 100 transactions to identify key revenue drivers, best-selling products, and regional performance. The analysis was conducted using Python and the Pandas library.

2. Methodology
The project followed a structured 5-day data science workflow:
1. Data Loading: Imported raw CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Exploration: Checked data dimensions (100 rows, 7 columns) and verified data types.
3. Data Cleaning: * Checked for missing values (None found).
Checked for duplicate entries (None found).
4. Analysis: Calculated total revenue, average order value, and grouped data by product and region.

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following table summarizes the core financial health of the sales period:

Metric                        Value
Total Revenue           "₹12,365,048.00"
Total Orders                  100
Average Order Value      "₹123,650.48"
Best-Selling Product         Laptop
Top Performing Region         North

4. Detailed Findings
Product Performance (by Revenue)
Laptops are the primary revenue generator for the business, followed by Tablets.
Laptop: ₹3,889,210
Tablet: ₹2,884,340
Phone: ₹2,859,394
Headphones: ₹1,384,033
Monitor: ₹1,348,071

Regional BreakdownThe North region leads in sales, contributing over ₹3.9 million to the total revenue. This suggests a strong market presence or higher demand for high-value items like Laptops in that specific area.

5. Insights & Recommendations
 Inventory Focus: Since Laptops account for the highest revenue and volume (136 units), inventory levels should be prioritized for this category to prevent stockouts.
 Regional Strategy: The North region is the most profitable. Marketing efforts could be doubled here, or "look-alike" strategies could be applied to the East and West regions to boost their performance.Bundle  
 Opportunities: Since Headphones and Monitors have lower revenue, they could be bundled with Laptop sales (e.g., "The Home Office Bundle") to increase the average order value further.
