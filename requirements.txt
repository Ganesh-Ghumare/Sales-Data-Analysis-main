1. Technical Requirements
Library: Use the pandas library for all data manipulation and analysis.

Data Handling: * Load the data from a CSV file.

Inspect and handle missing values (e.g., filling them with zeros or removing them).

Remove any duplicate entries to ensure accuracy.

Calculations: You must calculate at least 3 different metrics. In your project, we calculated:

Total Revenue

Average Order Value

Best-Selling Product (by Revenue and Quantity)

Top Performing Region

Output: Create a clean, formatted report that is easy for a human to read (using headers, lines, and currency formatting).

Documentation: Add comments 

2. Procedural Requirements 
The project is designed to be completed over 5 days to build a habit of structured analysis:

Day 1 (Setup): Install the necessary tools and get the file into your Python environment.

Day 2 (Exploration): Use commands like .info(), .head(), and .shape to understand what you are working with.

Day 3 (Cleaning): Fix the "dirty" parts of the data (empty cells or double-entries).

Day 4 (Analysis): Use math functions like .sum(), .mean(), and .groupby() to find the insights.

Day 5 (Reporting): Use print() statements and f-strings (formatted strings) to present your findings professionally.

3. Skills Required 
Basic Python: Understanding variables, strings, and print statements.

Pandas Basics: Knowing how to filter columns and group data.

Logical Thinking: Deciding which metrics actually matter to a business (e.g., knowing that "Total Sales" is more important than "Customer ID numbers").
